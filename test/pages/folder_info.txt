# Pages Directory

This directory contains Page Object Model (POM) implementations that represent UI screens and their interactions.

## Purpose:
- Implement Page Object Model design pattern
- Encapsulate page-specific elements and actions
- Provide reusable page interaction methods
- Maintain separation between test logic and page implementation
