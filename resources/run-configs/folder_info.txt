# Run Configurations Directory

This directory contains execution configuration templates and settings for different test running scenarios.

## Purpose:
- Define different test execution configurations
- Environment-specific runner settings
- CI/CD pipeline configuration templates
- Parallel execution and retry strategies

## Configuration Types:

### Local Development
- Single browser execution
- Verbose logging enabled
- Screenshots and videos on failure
- Fast feedback for developers

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Headless browser execution
- Parallel test execution
- Retry on failure enabled
- Artifact collection and reporting

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Multiple browser configurations
- Cloud execution settings (LambdaTest, BrowserStack)
- Device and resolution matrices
- Compatibility test suites

### Performance Testing
- Extended timeouts for slow operations
- Memory and CPU monitoring
- Load testing configurations
- Performance metric collection

## Usage:
Run configurations can be applied via:
- Command line arguments
- Environment variables
- Configuration file selection
- Runtime parameter overrides

## Integration:
- Cucumber runner configurations
- Playwright test runner settings
- CI/CD workflow templates
- Docker container configurations
